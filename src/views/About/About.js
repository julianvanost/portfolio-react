                Julian has experience in front-end web development, using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and more. Most of his
                experience in previous jobs pertained to a tech stack that was outdated by at least a few years. He is
                currently working on catching up and mastering the new technologies as well as learning the newer
                frameworks. Another goal is to become proficient in full-stack development for web applications.
            </p>
              <p>
                In the long run, Julian intends on working his hardest on developing these skills in order to continue a
                career in web design and development.
